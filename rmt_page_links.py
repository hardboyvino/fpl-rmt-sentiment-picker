"""
The post IDs for all the Rate My Team pages for the respective GWs.

IDs are updated daily (hopefully), but as often as possible.

All IDs attached to the GW are the pages for the days before the GW, after the last deadline 

i.e. GW23 IDs are all the pages after GW 22 but before GW23 so usually the deadline day links are not included but is not a hard non-inclusion rule.
